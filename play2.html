        <h3 class="ladymarkby"><i class='fas fa-user'>LADY MARKBY.</i></h3><p class="speech">.  Good evening, dear Gertrude!  So kind of you to let me
    bring my friend, Mrs. Cheveley.  Two such charming women should know each</p>
    other!
    
    <h3 class="ladychiltern"><i class='fas fa-user'>LADY CHILTERN.</i></h3><p class="speech">. <p class="stage-direction"> [_Advances towards_ MRS. CHEVELEY _with a sweet smile_.
    _Then suddenly stops_, _and bows rather distantly_.]</p>  I think Mrs.
    Cheveley and I have met before.  I did not know she had married a second</p>
    time.
    
    <h3 class="ladymarkby"><i class='fas fa-user'>LADY MARKBY.</i></h3><p class="speech">. <p class="stage-direction">  [_Genially_.] </p> Ah, nowadays people marry as often as they
    can, donâ€™t they?  It is most fashionable. <p class="stage-direction"> [_To_ DUCHESS OF MARYBOROUGH.]</p>
    Dear Duchess, and how is the Duke?  Brain still weak, I suppose?  Well,
    that is only to be expected, is it not?  His good father was just the
    same.  There is nothing like race, is there?
