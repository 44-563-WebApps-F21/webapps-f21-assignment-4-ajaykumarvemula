        <h3 class="name"><i class="fas fa-user">MRS. MARCHMONT.></i></h3>
        <p class="speech mrsmarchmon">Yes. Horribly tedious parties they give, don’t they?</p>

        <h3 class="name"><i class="fas fa-user"> LADY BASTLDON.</i></h3>
        <p class="speech ladybastldon"> Horribly tedious! Never know why I go. Never know why I
            go anywhere.</p>

            <h3 class="name"><i class="fas fa-user">MRS. MARCHMONT.></i></h3>
        <p class="speech mrsmarchmon"> I come here to be educated.</p>

        <h3 class="name"><i class="fas fa-user"> LADY BASTLDON.</i></h3>
        <p class="speech ladybastldon"> Ah! I hate being educated!</p>

        <h3 class="name"><i class="fas fa-user">MRS. MARCHMONT.></i></h3>
        <p class="speech mrsmarchmon"> So do I. It puts one almost on a level with the
            commercial classes, doesn’t it? But dear Gertrude Chiltern is always
            telling me that I should have some serious purpose in life. So I come
            here to try to find one.</p>
            <h3 class="name"><i class="fas fa-user"> LADY BASTLDON.</i></h3>
        <p class="stage-direction">[_Looking round through her lorgnette_.]</p>
        <p class="speech ladybastldon">I don’t see
            anybody here to-night whom one could possibly call a serious purpose.
            The man who took me in to dinner talked to me about his wife the whole
            time.</p>

        <p class="speech ladybastldon"> How very trivial of him!</p>

        <h3 class="name"><i class="fas fa-user"> LADY BASTLDON.</i></h3>
        <p class="speech ladybastldon ">Terribly trivial! What did your man talk about?</p>

        <h3 class="name"><i class="fas fa-user">MRS. MARCHMONT.></i></h3>
        <p class="speech mrsmarchmont">About myself.</p>

        <h3 class="name"><i class="fas fa-user">MRS. MARCHMONT.></i></h3>
        <p class="speech mrsmarchmont"> How very trivial of him!</p>
        <h3 class="name">LADY BASILDON.</h3>
        <p class="stage-direction">[_Languidly_.]</p> class="speech">And were you interested?</p>

        <h3 class="name"><i class="fas fa-user">MRS. MARCHMONT.></i></h3>
        <p class="stage-direction">[_Shaking her head_.]</p>
        <p class="speech mrsmarchmont">Not in the smallest degree.</p>

        <h3 class="name"><i class="fas fa-user"> LADY BASTLDON.</i></h3>
        <p class="speech ladybastldon">What martyrs we are, dear Margaret!</p>

        <h3 class="name"><i class="fas fa-user">MRS. MARCHMONT.></i></h3>
        <p class="stage-direction">[_Rising_.]</p>
        <p class="speech mrsmarchmont"> And how well it becomes us, Olivia!

        <p class="stage-direction"> [_They rise and go towards the music-room_. _The_ VICOMTE DE NANJAC, _a
            young attaché known for his neckties and his Anglomania_, _approaches
            with a low bow_, _and enters into conversation_.]</p>
        </p>

        <h3 class="name"><i class="fas fa-user"> MASON.</i></h3>
        <p class="speech">
        <p class="stage-direction">[_Announcing guests from the top of the staircase_.]</p> Mr. and
        Lady Jane Barford. Lord Caversham.

        <p class="stage-direction">[_Enter_ LORD CAVERSHAM, _an old gentleman of seventy_, _wearing the
            riband and star of the Garter_. _A fine Whig type_. _Rather like a
            portrait by Lawrence_.]</p>
        </p>

        <h3 class="name"><i class="fas fa-user">LORD CAVERSHAM.></i></h3>
        <p class="speech lordcaversham">Good evening, Lady Chiltern! Has my good-for-nothing
            young son been here?</p>

            <h3 class="name"><i class="fas fa-user">LADY CHILTERN.></i></h3>
        <p class="speech ladychiltern">
        <p class="stage-direction">[_Smiling_.]</p> I don’t think Lord Goring has arrived yet.</p>

        <h3 class="name"><i class="fas fa-user">MABEL CHILTERN.></i></h3>
        <p class="speech mabelchiltern">
        <p class="stage-direction">[_Coming up to_ LORD CAVERSHAM.]</p> Why do you call Lord
        Goring good-for-nothing?

        <p class="stage-direction">[MABEL CHILTERN _is a perfect example of the English type of prettiness_,
            _the apple-blossom type_. _She has all the fragrance and freedom of a
            flower_. _There is ripple after ripple of sunlight in her hair_, _and
            the little mouth_, _with its parted lips_, _is expectant_, _like the
            mouth of a child_. _She has the fascinating tyranny of youth_, _and the
            astonishing courage of innocence_. _To sane people she is not
            reminiscent of any work of art_. _But she is really like a Tanagra
            statuette_, _and would be rather annoyed if she were told so_.]</p>
        </p>

        <h3 class="name"><i class="fas fa-user">LORD CAVERSHAM.></i></h3>
        <p class="speech lordcaversham"> Because he leads such an idle life.</p>

        <h3 class="name"><i class="fas fa-user">MABEL CHILTERN.></i></h3>
        <p class="speech mabelchiltern"> How can you say such a thing? Why, he rides in the Row
            at ten o’clock in the morning, goes to the Opera three times a week,
            changes his clothes at least five times a day, and dines out every night
            of the season. You don’t call that leading an idle life, do you?</p>

            <h3 class="name"><i class="fas fa-user">LORD CAVERSHAM.></i></h3>
        <p class="stage-direction">[_Looking at her with a kindly twinkle in his eyes_.]</p>
        <p class="speech lordcaversham"> You are a very charming young lady!</p>

        <h3 class="name"><i class="fas fa-user">MABEL CHILTERN.></i></h3>
        <p class="speech mabelchiltern">How sweet of you to say that, Lord Caversham! Do come
            to us more often. You know we are always at home on Wednesdays, and you
            look so well with your star!</p>

            <h3 class="name"><i class="fas fa-user">LORD CAVERSHAM.></i></h3>
        <p class="speech lordcaversham"> Never go anywhere now. Sick of London Society.
            Shouldn’t mind being introduced to my own tailor; he always votes on the
            right side. But object strongly to being sent down to dinner with my
            wife’s milliner. Never could stand Lady Caversham’s bonnets.</p>

            <h3 class="name"><i class="fas fa-user">MABEL CHILTERN.></i></h3>
        <p class="speech mabelchiltern"> Oh, I love London Society! I think it has immensely
            improved. It is entirely composed now of beautiful idiots and brilliant
            lunatics. Just what Society should be.</p>

            <h3 class="name"><i class="fas fa-user">LORD CAVERSHAM.></i></h3>
        <p class="speech lordcaversham"> Hum! Which is Goring? Beautiful idiot, or the other
            thing?</p>

            <h3 class="name"><i class="fas fa-user">MABEL CHILTERN.></i></h3>
        <p class="speech mabelchiltern">
        <p class="stage-direction">[_Gravely_.]</p> I have been obliged for the present to put
        Lord Goring into a class quite by himself. But he is developing
        charmingly!</p>

        <h3 class="name"><i class="fas fa-user">LORD CAVERSHAM.></i></h3>
        <p class="speech lordcaversham">Into what?</p>

        <h3 class="name"><i class="fas fa-user">MABEL CHILTERN.></i></h3>
        <p class="speech mabelchiltern">
        <p class="stage-direction"> [_With a little curtsey_.]</p> I hope to let you know very
        soon, Lord Caversham!</p>
